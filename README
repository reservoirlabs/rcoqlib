This library requires Coq 8.5beta2.

Summary of subdirectories (each of which corresponds to its logical
path with the same name):

rcoqlib: general-purpose Coq libraries and tactics.

Installation: assuming that you already have a standard installation
of Coq 8.5beta2, GNU make.

  ./configure && make

After building, you do not need to move the files anywhere else (and,
by the way, `make install' does not work). The build system
automatically generates a ./run-coqide.sh script to edit the sources
with CoqIDE (if installed on your system), as well as local load path
configuration files for Emacs+ProofGeneral (if installed on your
system). If you want to compile code against R-CoqLib, just specify
`-R <thisdir>/rcoqlib rcoqlib' to Coq and its relevant tools (coqc,
coq_makefile, etc.), where <thisdir> is the absolute path to the
directory containing this README.
